I received my copy of [Programming in C (4th Edition) (Developer's Library)](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-4th-Edition-Developers-Library/dp/0321776410) from Pearson today.

The book is dense with 548 pages and, at first glance, a great resource for
beginners and advanced C coders. I'll let you know more about my reading. Just
wait.
