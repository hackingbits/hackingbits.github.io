As promised I'm back to talk about the [Programming in C (4th Edition)
(Developer's
Library)](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-4th-Edition-Developers-Library/dp/0321776410)
book. Well, I'll paste my amazon's review, to be short.

<!--more-->

> When I started this reading soon I became absorbed by the formation of the
writer's words. Unfortunately that feeling did not persist throughout the work.
I still read until functions chapter, but the book is not renewed in style.
There's much prolonged talk for bit subjects... For me a boring approach. The
author uses many almost useless, in day-to-day, mathematical examples. A
beginner will give up of C language or seek another book that is more aimed. I
still prefer the Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets by Peter van der Linden
that invites you to understand language with real facts about C, and The C
Programming Language by the creators of the Language that despite being old and
summarized, informs the reader about the language accurately.

It's up to you.

Cheers.
