Hi there,

I would like to share with you this [Coverity post
(Andy)](http://security.coverity.com/blog/2013/Oct/deliberate-null-pointer-dereferences-in-the-linux-kernel.html)
which, somehow, I have instigated through discussion in
[lkml](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/21/387). Andy's argument corroborates with
mine, which concerns the deceptive "it works" mantra.
